## introduce
The vocabulary learning software available in the market usually comes with a predefined word list, but often the words included may not be of interest to you. Therefore, we envision a software that allows users to maintain their own personalized word list, giving them complete autonomy. Through program design, it would record proficiency levels, provide example sentences, and offer other mnemonic aids to help users memorize words more efficiently and with self-motivation.

This program offers English learners with a solid foundation a highly flexible word-assistance memory function. Users can independently add words, word definitions, example sentences, and word notes. The program provides word review functionality, and users can customize and modify corresponding example sentences or notes during the review process, providing a more convenient learning experience.

In addition, the program includes a built-in Wordle mini-game, allowing users to learn and reinforce English skills through gaming.
